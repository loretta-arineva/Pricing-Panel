# Pricing-Panel

This is a small project given by my online bootcamp course as an assignment.

It containts a pricing panel with example plans that the user can choose from.

**Note:** All of my projects focus on readibility, accessibility, responsiveness, semantics.  I always try to apply DRY refactor my code.
